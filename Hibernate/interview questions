what is hibernate and why to use it?

  it is an ORM tool used to map java objects and database table 
  java /pojoobject (ORM)-> database table

it is a JPA implementation hence we use JPA annotations as well as XML configuration 
to achieve this mapping

why hibernate? FM

  eliminate all the boiler plate code that comes with JDBC 
    ( so many time you wrote the same code againa and agin to don one particular transcaiton it sliminates)
  
  it support HQL which is object oriented
  it provide transacion management implicitly
    ( on jdbc we have to manage transcation management by our self )
  hibernate throws JBDCException or HibernateExpcetion which are unchecked exception
  so we dont need to wory about handling using try  and catch
  Hibernate supports caching for better performance
--------
hint: chekced expecion on ehave to be either caught or declaed in mehod signature using throws
where as unchecked ones is optional, cannt be handled via code, so try cantch block is not required
--------

3. what are important interface used in Hibernate?

SessionFactory:  we can get the Session object from sessionfactory
  there should be 1 sessionFactory object per Database connection ( like 1 for MySQL , 1 for Oracle)
  this is an Instance used to retreive session object for database operations
  we need to initialize once and can cache it to reuse it again and again

Session: from session we get transaction object
  it is used to get the physical connection with database
  it is a factory for transaction
  used for conneting application with persistant store like hibernate fm/db
  provide methods for CRUD opeations

Transaction: this specific single/atomic units of work

so sessinofactor is the parent using this we get the session object using this we got transaction

we need to build tht session facotory

SessioonFactorh factory = metadata.getSessionfactoryBuilder().build();
Session sessino = factory.openSession();
Transaction t = session.beginTransaction();

session.save(persistnaobje); //save or update or delte  soemting on this transacion
  t.commit();
  factory.close();
    session.close();

3. important Annotation used in Hibernate?

@Entity : used with model class to specify that they are entity beans
@Table : used with entity bean to dfne corresponding table name in database
@Access: used to define the access type
for eg:  @Accesss(value= AccessType.PROPERTY)

@Id: used to define primary eky in the entity bean
@EmbeddedId : used to define composite primary key in the entity bean
( so every tiem we are not going to have a single parimary in our table

@Column - field level annotation to define a column name

@GeneratedValue: used for generation of primary key
    GenerationType.ENUM (eg; IDENTITY.AUTO.ETC)

@OneToOne  - 
@OneToMany
@ManuToOne
@ManyToMany

@Cascade - used to define the cascading between two entity beans used with mappings

@PriaryKeyJoinColumn: used to define for foreign key 

4.Mappings in Hibernate?

Association mapping in hibernate!
3 typed

one-to-one
Many-to-one
many-to-many

--

@OneToOne(targetEntity=CodeDecode.class)
private CodeDecode codeDecode;

Class Student{
@ManyToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
private Address address;
