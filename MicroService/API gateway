what is API gateway?

single entry point for all clients that routes request to backend servicces

we expose only API gateway to the UI, it handled authencitacaion ,
routing and loggin, reducing coupling with backend serrvices

⚠️ Why not call microservices directly from UI?
✅ Answer:
It increases security risk, tight coupling, and makes client changes harder.

2️⃣ Service Discovery Pattern

needed for container restart, ips change dynamically
tool: netflix eureka

each service registers with eureak at startup and resolved other services dynamicaly

do we still need eureka in kubernetes?
no kubenerte provides buit in DNS-Based serrvice discovery

3️⃣ Circuit Breaker Pattern (VERY HOT 🔥)

  to prevent cascading failures
  tools: Resilence4j
  
  states:
  closed-normal
  Open - stop calls
  Half open - trial calls
  
  scenario:
  when notification service was down, circuit breaker opened so booking service continued
  without delays.
  
  is retring always good?
  no - retry storms can crash systems

4️⃣ Saga Pattern (TRANSACTIONS)
------------------------------

problem no @Transactional across services

solutions:
choregraphy (events)
Orchestration(central controller)

Each service perform a local transaction and compensates if a step fails
