MicroSercie architectural fundamentals

microservice is an architeucrual style where application are decompossed into samll, independelally
deployable services. each owning a specific businesss capability and databbase

each service = separate spring boot project

Tricky Question 🔥
👉Is microservices only about splitting services?

No.its about independant deployment, ownership and scalability, not just splitting code

👉 Why companies still use monolith??

is fine for small team and early stage products,
& Microsercice introduce Operational complexity

How do microsercice communicate?

REST - Synchronoue
Messagein(kafka/rabbitmq) - Asynchronouse

we used Synchronouse REST for core flows and 
Asynchronouse messaging for notification to avoid tight coupling

why not REST everywhere?

🔹cREST create tight coupling and cascading failures
🔹Asyn improves resilence and scalability!

what is Session Discovery & Routing?

  tools like Netflix Eureka
  implemntation:
  Service register on starup
  other service resolve dynamicaly
  
  we ccan avoid Eureka? kubernetes provide built in service discovery via DNS

6️⃣ API Gateway (VERY IMPORTANT 🔥)

tool: spring cloud gatesay

Responsibilities

Auth
Routing
Rate limiting
Logging

UI never direclty accessed services, all calls went through API gateway onlt
can APi gateway become a single point of failure?
yes, so we deploy it in multiple instnaces with load balaning

Database per Service – WHY?

to enuser loose coupling and independent schema evolution

how do you join data?
 API composition or Event Driven replication

Distributed Transactions ❌

Correct Pattern ; Saga Pattern

Tricky Question
Why not use @Transactional across services?
 Because distributed transactions reduce scalability and are failure-prone.


🔹 SECTION 5: FAULT TOLERANCE & RESILIENCE

how do you handle failure?

pattern: circuit breaker, retry, timeout, fallback

tools: resilence4j

Retry always good?
Answer
No. Retrying can overload a failing service (retry storm).

Circuit Breaker States
State	Meaning
CLOSED	Normal
OPEN	Stop calls
HALF-OPEN	Trial calls

🔹 SECTION 6: SECURITY

how is scurity implemented?

  JWT at api gateway
  intenal service trust gateway

why not vaiidate JWT in every service?
  Redundatn processing and performance overhead

Config & Versioning:

-Centralized configuration- we have a tool: spring cloud config

Tricky Question

What if config server is down?
Answer
Services cache config locally

API versioning:

approaches : URI versiong & Header Versioning

we followed URI versioning for backward compatibility!

❓ Are microservices faster?

❌ No. Network latency exists.

❓ Can microservices share DB?

❌ Violates independence.
