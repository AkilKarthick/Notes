feign_client_notes

to communicate between multiple services 
a declarative HTTP client in spring cloud ecosystem
it helps microservice communication with each other eaasily via rest api's
without boiler plate code like Rest-template or webClient code
-feign integerate with Eureka for service discovery & spring cloud balancer
to provide a load balancered http client

exmaple

bookcatalog-api [controller|service|repository -db ]
admindashboard-api [ controller| service | repo =db ]

if you are using Rest-template you need to write the code  on service of
bookcatalog-api, by calling the method of Rest-template communicate with book api

but here in feign client- you create one client -interface - which will 
behave like a feign client

@FeignClient - the interface should be annotated with

@FeignClient(name= microservice-name , URL =)

if you are using eureka toghther means non need to give URL 
it is enought to provide the name of the microservice
