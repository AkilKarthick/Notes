Memory management interview questions


explain java memory management?
what is garbase collection in java? and its types?
what is finalize() method?
statck vs heap memeory allocation
how to handle out of memmroy Exception?


---------------------------------
1.explain java memory management?

the process by which jvm automatically alloates memeory to objects and deallocate memory that is no longe used, heping to prevent memory leaks and optimize usage

heap memory - exists as long jvm run, & a shared run time area where all the java obj & arrays are allocated & managed by garbage collecto
Exists during application runtime


stack memory: each thread has its own stack storing local variibl, method call & refernce, it is a short lived & automatically grow and shrink during method execution
Lifespan tied to method execution


------------------------------------------------------


2.what is garbase collection in java? and its types?

gc is a automatic memory mnangement process, by which JVM idneifies and remove objects that are no longer reachable 
freeing heap memory for reuse

types of garbage collection:

Minor GC: check where new objects areallocated it run frequently and fast

major GC: where long lived objects are stored, it is less frequently but more time consuming

full GC: combination of minor and major GC, cleaning the Entire heap 


---------------------
3.finalize() method

it is depreciated in newer java version with try-with-resou and explicit cleanup methods are there

protected method() in the object class invoked by the gb collectors before object destruction


------------------------------

how to handle out of memory Exception?

occurs when JVM heap or stack memory is exhausted and cannot allocate more objects
how to handnel this

Analyze heap usage and leaks using profiling tools
Optimize code to release references to unused objects.
Avoid creating large unnecessary objects or collections
Use proper data structures and caching strategies
Ensure external resources are closed properly  lie fil stream close
