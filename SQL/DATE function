DATE function
    1. current_date -> only date
    2. now() -> along with date and time

SELECT CURRENT_DATE;
SELECT NOW();

-----------------------
3.DATEDIFF(date1, date2)

    SELECT DATEDIFF('2025-11-08', '2025-11-01');  -- 7 days
    
    for EG:    
    Find employees who completed probation ( > 90 days )  
        select emp_name
        from employee
        where DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, join_date) > 90;

3) DATE_ADD() / DATE_SUB()
    Add or subtract days, months, years.
    
        select date_add(current_date, Interval 30 days);
        select date_sub(current_date, interval 6 month);

4) EXTRACT()
    Pulls parts of a date.

    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hiredate);
    SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM hiredate);
    SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM hiredate);

5) MONTHNAME() / DAYNAME()

       Human readable names.

    SELECT MONTHNAME('2025-02-10'); -- February
    SELECT DAYNAME('2025-02-10');   -- Monday
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

for EG:

Q1. Employees joined in the last 30 days

  select emp_name
  from employee
  where join_date >= current_Date - Interval 30 days;


Q2. Employees joined this year

select emp_name
from employee
where EXTRACT(year from join_date) = EXTRACT(year from current_date);

Q3. Group employees by joining month

select MonthName(join_date) as month_name, count(*)
from employee
GROUP BY MONTH(join_date)
order by month(join _date)


-----------------------------------
orders(order_id, amount, order_date, customer_id)

Q1) Get orders from last 7 days.

    select * 
    from orders
    where  current_date(order_date) - interval 7 day //wrong
    
    select * from orders
    where order_date >= CURRENT_DATE -INTERVAL 7 DAYS;

Q2) Get orders placed in January (any year).

//werong
    select * 
    from orders
    where order_date = EXTRACT(month from order_date)=1 
correct??
    
    select * 
    from orders
    where EXTRACT(month from order_date) =1;

or
    select * from orders
    where month(order_date) =1;
 or
    SELECT *
    FROM orders
    WHERE MONTHNAME(order_date) = 'January';

Q3) Calculate how many days since last order.
orders(order_id, amount, order_date, customer_id)

wrong//
    select order_id, order_date from order
    where orderdate >= extract(days from order_date) -interval current_date

correct//
select order_id, order_date, DATEDIFF(current_date, order_date) AS days_since_order
from order

Q4) Show monthly sales total (group by month).
