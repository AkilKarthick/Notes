Microservice

each microerive should be doing one business job only
for eg:

User Service → user data
Order Service → orders
Payment Service → payments

Each service owns its own database.

  shared DB - tightly coupled
  SeparateDB - independence
Database-per-service avoids tight coupling between services

API gateway: a single entry point for clients in microservice
             || client -> api gateway -> service ||

3. Failre Handling:

if payment service fails: order service and user service will works
this is fault isolation

microservice- confi management:

why config management is needed?
in microservice, many service & many environment ( dev, qa prod)
so config should be either externalized or centralized!

SERVICE DISCOVERY:

what problm we face without service discovery? service has dynamic IPs, hardcoding URL

what is service discovery?

a Registry where services: register themselves, discover others dynamicallly
service discovery helps services locate each other dynamically

what is load balancing? distribute traffic across instance to improve availbility

distribute request across multpe service instances

Client → LB → Service Instance 1
              Service Instance 2
why we need ?
high availbility & better performance
