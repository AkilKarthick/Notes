Microservice

each microerive should be doing one business job only
for eg:

User Service → user data
Order Service → orders
Payment Service → payments

Each service owns its own database.

  shared DB - tightly coupled
  SeparateDB - independence
Database-per-service avoids tight coupling between services

API gateway: a single entry point for clients in microservice
             || client -> api gateway -> service ||

3. Failre Handling:

if payment service fails: order service and user service will works
this is fault isolation

microservice- confi management:

why config management is needed?
in microservice, many service & many environment ( dev, qa prod)
so config should be either externalized or centralized!
