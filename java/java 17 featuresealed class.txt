    String username;
    public User(String username) { this.username = username; }
    public String getUsername() { return username; }
}

public final class AdminUser extends User {
    public AdminUser(String username) { super(username); }
    public void accessAdminPanel() {
        System.out.println(username + " is accessing the admin panel.");
    }
}

public final class GuestUser extends User {
