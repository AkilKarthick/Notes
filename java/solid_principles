In Spring Boot, these principles are naturally applied using interfaces,
dependency injection, and layered architecture.

SOLID is a set of 5 design pinciples that help you to write 
clearn code
maintainable code
scalable code
testable code

s - single responsiblity principle (SRP) 
---------------------------------------

a class should have only one reason to change
eg: 
❌ Bad example c;as Userservice{} 
                   saveUser()
                   sendEmail()  }
                   
✅ Good example class Userservice & class EmailSerivce
so SRP reduce the readabiltiy & reduce impact of changes

O - open and closed principe (OCP)
----------------------------------

open for extension 
closed for modification

good to use interface 
OCP avoid modfying tested code and reduces regression risk

L- liskov substituion principle (LSP)
-------------------------------------
to avoid unexpected run time errors
clean inheritance hiearchy

Lsp ensure polymorphsih works correclty

i- interfcae segregation principle (ISP)
----------------------------------------

dont force a class to implement a method it doesn't need
ISP avoid unnecessary implementations

D- dependency inversion principle (DIP)
---------------------------------------
