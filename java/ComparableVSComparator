1.difference between comparable & comparator

both are used for sorting the objects
  compareable = compareTo() -compare myself (sorting order inside the class) define Natural order
  comparator = compare() - compare others (sortint loging outside the class) define custome order 
  
  comparable: when a class want to define its own natural order using compareTo() method
   natural/default
  implements Inside the class itself
  
  comparator: allows custom sorting logic outside the class using compare() method
  custom or multiple sorting orders
  impements Outside the class, separate class or lambda

java 8 support Comparator using lambda expression for concise sorting
emploeList.sort(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName))

in real projet, we prefer Comparator because it avoids modifying entity class and support multiple sorting requirements

foreg:

assume you have an Employee entity that used across the applications!

class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;
    double salary;

    // getters & setters
}
modifying it can impact other modules | so adding implements Comparable is not prfered

class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {
    public int compareTo(Employee e) {
        return Double.compare(this.salary, e.salary);
    }
}

if you using this means only one sorting login| entity class modified \ violates single responsiblity principle
if you using Comparator: entity remain clean | java 8 friendly | multiple soring design | better design

so Comparator keeps entity class clean and support multiple dynamic soring requirements
such as soring by name, sal or comination using java 8 lambdas

Comparaot<Employee> sortByNmae = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName);
Collection.sort(employeeList,sortByName);

Comparator<Employee> sortBySalary = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary);
Collectios.sort(employeeList,sortyBySalary);
