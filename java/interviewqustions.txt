
EG:
parent class having one static method 
child class extends parent class & overrid the static method

-----------------------
2. what is fail fast iteration and how to handle it?

List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(List.of("A", "B", "C"));
Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();

while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    String value = iterator.next();
    // Modifying the collection directly during iteration
    if (value.equals("B")) {
        list.add("D");  // This triggers ConcurrentModificationException
    }
}


for a normal collection when you try to add elementes during iteration will throw concurrentmodificaion exception 
Alternatively use thread safe collections lke concureenthashmap won't throw you expceotin
whose iterators are thread safe 

------------------

final & finally & finalize()?


final

A final variable cannot be changed once assigned.
A final method cannot be overridden in subclasses.
A final class cannot be extended (no subclassing)

final int x = 10;
// x = 20; // Error: cannot change a final variable

final class A {} // Cannot extend class A

class B {
    final void show() {}
    // Subclasses cannot override show()
}

finally:
The finally block is used in exception handling.
Placed after a try-catch block

try {
    // risky code
} catch(Exception e) {
    // exception handling
} finally {
    // always executed
}

finalize()::

Cleanup before object destruction
Called by the garbage collector before destroying an object
 
protected void finalize() {
    // cleanup code
}
----------------------------
autoboxing & autounboxing

 automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class object by the Java compiler

int a = 10;
Integer obj = a; // autoboxing: int to Integer

Useful when working with collections that can only store objects

Autounboxing

Autounboxing (commonly called "unboxing") is the reverse process: automatic conversion of a wrapper class object to its corresponding primitive type


List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(5); // autoboxing: int 5 to Integer object
list.add(10);

int sum = list.get(0) + list.get(1); // unboxing: Integer objects to int
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); // Output: Sum: 15

-----------------------------------------------
what is clonable? deep clone vs shallow clones?


clonable is a marker interface without any methods()
when a class implements Clonable, it indicates that objects of this class can be cloned safely using clone() method.

If a class does not implement Cloneable and you call clone(), it throws a CloneNotSupportedException


clone() method that performs the object copying is actually defined in the Object class, not in Cloneablclone() method that performs the object copying is actually defined in the Object class, not in Cloneable
ie native method



1.shallow copy: Copies primitive fields and references

clone() creates a shallow copy: fields like int and String (immutable) are copied
Both original and clone share referenced objects

class Student implements Cloneable {
    int id;
    String name;

    Student(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone(); // calls Object's clone, shallow copy
    }
}

public class TestClone {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Student s1 = new Student(1, "John");
        Student s2 = (Student) s1.clone(); // cloning s1 to s2

        System.out.println(s1.id + " " + s1.name); // 1 John
        System.out.println(s2.id + " " + s2.name); // 1 John

        s2.name = "Alex";
        System.out.println(s1.name); // John (s1 not affected)
    }
}

Deep copy: Copies primitives and creates new copies of objects referenced inside fields

Deep copy requires manual override of clone()
explicitly clone referenced objects inside the class.
Original and clone have independent referenced objects

eg:

class Department implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    Department(String name) { this.name = name; }
    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();

class Employee implements Cloneable {
    int id;
    Department dept;
    Employee(int id, Department dept) {
        this.id = id;
        this.dept = dept;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Employee cloned = (Employee) super.clone();
        // Deep cloning: cloning referenced object explicitly
        cloned.dept = (Department) dept.clone();
        return cloned;

public class TestDeepClone {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Department d1 = new Department("HR");
        Employee e1 = new Employee(100, d1);
        Employee e2 = (Employee) e1.clone();

        e2.dept.name = "Finance";

        System.out.println(e1.dept.name); // HR (unchanged)
        System.out.println(e2.dept.name); // Finance
