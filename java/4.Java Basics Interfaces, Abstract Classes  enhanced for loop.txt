Java Basics: Interfaces, Abstract Classes | enhanced for loop


INTERFACES

An interface defines a contract of abstract methods (no implementation) that implementing classes must provide.

It supports multiple inheritance for types 
(a class can implement multiple interfaces).

From Java 8+,
 interfaces can have default and static methods with concrete implementations

from java 9

private method also we can implemented 



---------------
ABSTRACT CLASSES

An abstract class can have abstract (unimplemented) methods
as well as concrete (implemented) methods.

It cannot be instantiated directly; subclasses must provide implementations for abstract methods.


for eg::

// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    public abstract void sound();

    // Regular method
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping");
    }

--------------------------------
Enhanced For Loop (For-Each Loop)

iterating through collections and arrays simpler and safer.
for EG:

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
for (int n : numbers) {
    System.out.println(n);
}
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob");
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}
