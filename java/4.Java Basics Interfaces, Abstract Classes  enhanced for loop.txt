Java Basics: Interfaces, Abstract Classes | enhanced for loop


📌INTERFACES

✅variable present inside interface must be 
   -public, static & final- by default
✅interface cannot have constructor
✅we cannot override static method from interface
   (static method belong to interface, not class)
✅interface can extend multple interface ✅ YES ( interface c extends A,B{} )
✅what happpends if two interface have same defautl method?
     compile-time error unless overriden 
  🧩 A.super.test(); // OR B.super.test()

 🔑Multiple inheritance is possible via interfaces in Java, but when ambiguity occurs (same default method), Java forces the class to resolve it explicitly.
 This avoids the Diamond Problem.

An interface defines a contract of abstract methods (no implementation) that implementing classes must provide.

It supports multiple inheritance for types 
(a class can implement multiple interfaces).

From Java 8+,
 interfaces can have default and static methods with concrete implementations

from java 9

private method also we can implemented 

---------------
ABSTRACT CLASSES


how?
Can an abstract class implement an interface without implementing methods?
✅ YES

An abstract class can have abstract (unimplemented) methods
as well as concrete (implemented) methods.

It cannot be instantiated directly; subclasses must provide implementations for abstract methods.


for eg::

// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    public abstract void sound();

    // Regular method
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping");
    }

--------------------------------
Enhanced For Loop (For-Each Loop)

iterating through collections and arrays simpler and safer.
for EG:

int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
for (int n : numbers) {
    System.out.println(n);
}
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob");
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}
