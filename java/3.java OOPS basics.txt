java OOPS basics:

class: it is like a blueprint or template for creating an objects with properties andmethods

objects: instance of the calss representing real world entities

	1.encapsulation: hiding internal data and providing access thorugh methods eg: getter & setters
	
	2.inheritance: mechanism to create new classes from existing one, enabling code reuse
	
	3.polymorphism: ability to take many forms, method behave differently based on object type
	
	4.abstraction: hiding complex details & shows only necessary parts to the users
============================================================================================

-------------🗣️ Interview-ready explanation
A.encapsulation:  we used encapsulation to hide internal data and expose only require behavirou through getter and setter
in our springboot services, entities are encapsulated to avoid direct field access!
entity fiels we kept as private !
------

keep data safe by restricting access with private fields
	getter and setter
to protects data by making class variables private and controlling access with public getter and setter methods.

	encapsulation ensures critical shipment details such as package weight, destination address, and delivery status are protected from unintended changes

public class ShipmentPackage {
    // Private fields - hidden from external access
    private String packageId;
    private double weight;       // in kilograms
    private String destination;

 // Getter and setter for packageId

----------------------------------------------------------

B.inheritance: allows a class to reuse properties and method of another clas
why it is used: code reusability , reduce duplication

🏗️ Real project usage
we use inheritance in our poject wheere common fields are maintaiend in base entity class
and extended by all entities

types of inheritance;

	 single, :: class inhert from super class
	 multilevel,:: class inhert from subclass whihch itslef inhert from parent class
	 hierarchical ::multiple subclasses inhert from a single super classes
	 multiple inheritance using interface :: class implements multile interfaces to inhert varuious behaviours

a hierarchical inheritance means multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass. The superclass provides common properties and methods, and each subclass extends or overrides them for specialization.

--------------
C.polymorphism: allows one method to behave differently based on the object type
why it is sued : loosely coupled! thing

🏗️Real project usage

“In Spring, we use polymorphism when multiple service implementations exist for the same interface.”

interface PaymentService {
    void pay();
}
class CardPayment implements PaymentService {
    public void pay() { }
}
class UpiPayment implements PaymentService {
    public void pay() { }
}

ability to behave differently based on the object type

	a.compile time (overloading) - same method name with different parameters

		in example i can say like calulatingCost(int weight) || calculatingcost(int weight, dimesnsion) so same method with different arguments within same class
		method overloading helped in developing flexible shipment cost calculators that could take various parameter combinations like weight, dimensions, urgency, or discounts, all under the same method name calculateCost()

	b.run time (overriding) - a subclass provide its own implementation of a method

		parent class shipemtnSerice
		having processShipment() method generic method

		presented on below sub classes with @Override
		AirShipmentservivce| gorundshipmentsevice & internationsshipment serice 

		We had a base ShipmentService class that defined processShipment(), and subclasses for air, ground, and international shipments overrode this method to apply specialized business rules
----------------------------


Abstraction: hides complex implementation details via abstract class 
			or interface exposing only relevant functionalities


aggregation- once class has a reference to another HAS A RELationship

composition-  stronger from of aggregation where the contained obj can't exist independently
-----------

what is constructor?
 a special method that run automatically when you create an object using new keyword
purpose:
initialize object data
put the object into a valid state

	class Person {
		int age;
	
	person(){
		age = 20; 
		}
	}
	
	public class main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Person p = new Person();
		Sysout(p.age);
	}

hit:
if you don't provide a constructor , compioler itslef provide one default one
2. parametrized construcor:
	
class Person {
		int id; // instnace variable
	
	person(int id){
		this.id = id; // this.id  is instance variable & id is local variable 
		}
	}

hint:

constructor is same name as class name
no return type
Runs automatically
used to intialize

can constructor return a value?
No, not even a void 


---hint:
most consufsing part!

class Animal{
	Animal() {
	System.out.println("animal const")
	}
}
class Dog extends Animal {
	Dog() {
	super(); //implict
	System.out.println("Dog cons ")
	}
}

Execution order:
	anmial const
	Dog cons     // Parent constructor always runs first


why super() must be the first line>

Parent must be initialized before child
java enforce this rule!

for EG: importane 

class A {
	A(int x){}

class B extends A {
	B() {
	//Error 
	}

why bc implicit super construt A() is undefined
so 
B() {
	super(10) 
	}

Constructor Chaining

calling one const from another const using this() method

class Demo{
	Demo(){
		this(10);
		Sysout('no args');
	Demo(int x) { 	//const overloading is alos possible
		Sysout('no args');


Constructor initialize object state
constructor is invoked automatically during object creatieon
parent const is called before chidl constr
if parent has pareametrezed constructor, child must expliclty call super()
you cannot use this() and super() together

super- calls parent const
this() - calls another construcot in same calss
both must be first line
