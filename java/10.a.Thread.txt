Thread: a light weight process that executes a task

	a lightweight process called thread & it allow different part of a programs to execute simulatenously
	
creating a thread in java 
	-is by extending 💡 Thread class or by implementing Runnable 💡 interface

1.Thread class -- Extend Thread when no other class inheritance is needed
2.Runnable interface --Implement Runnable when the class already extends another class (preferred). - java support only single inheritance that;s why

in project we always prefer Runnable or ExecturService for better design and scalability

🔥Extending Thread class:
	poor design, can't extend another class, Tight coupling

eg1:

class Mythread extends Thread{

	public void run(){
	System.out.println("Thread Started Running...");
	}
}

public class Demo {
	public static void main(string[] args){
	MyThread t1 = new Mythread();
	t1.start(); //start() will internally call run() method
	}
}

🔥 implementing runnable interface // preferred ay
		Better design, Support inheritance & loose coupling

class MyRunnable implements Runnable{
	public void run(){
	System.out.println("Thread Started Running...");
	}

}

public class Demo {
	public static void main(string[] args){

//creating an instance of the class MyRunnable
	MyRunnable mr = new MyRunnable();
	Thread t1 = new thread(mr);

	t1.start(); //start() will internally call run() method
	}
}

Thread Lifecycle (VERY IMPORTANT 🔥)

states:

	new
	Runnable
	Running
	Waiting/Blocked
	Terminateed








single thread - one task at a time
============================================================
multiple Thread: 
---------------
running multiple thread simultaneously to perform different task at the same time
which improve performance and cpu utilizations,  
each thread run independently but shares the same memory space
allows concurrent execution of task to improve perfromance

used when : handling multple user request, fikle processing
interview hint : improves appplications responsiveness


class MyThread extends Thread {
    String task;

    MyThread(String task) {
        this.task = task;
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(task + " : " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Pause for 1 second
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}

public class MultiThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread("Cut the ticket");
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread("Show your seat number");
        
        t1.start(); // Start first thread
        t2.start(); // Start second thread
    }
}

output:
Cut the ticket : 1
Show your seat number : 1
Cut the ticket : 2
Show your seat number : 2
...
Cut the ticket : 5
Show your seat number : 5


Two threads (t1 and t2) run concurrently.

Each prints its respective task with a delay of 1 second.

Threads run independently, so their output interleaves, showing multitasking.

---------------------------------
what is synchronization

	it ensure only one thread executes a critical method/section at a time
	prevents race condtion and allowoing one thread at a time

only 1 thread at a time can enter this method!
	synchronized void increment() {
	    count++;
	}

what is thread pool?

	manage a fixed number of reusable threads to execute task concuretnly, reducing overhead of thread creation and destruction
	
	wait() // relase lock and wait for notification
	sleep() // doesn't release any lock and pause the thread for a specific time
	
	start() - create a new threa | multiple times means IllegalThreadStateException  throws

hwo thread communicate with each other ?

	through inter- thread communication method wait(), notify(), and notifyall() using inside 	synchronized blokc to coordinate execution

Thread lifecycle: / thread can go through multiple states during executions

new
Runnable
Running
Waiting/Blocked
Terminated

I haven’t directly created threads, but Spring Boot internally uses multithreading to handle concurrent requests, and I understand thread-safety concepts


States:
	New
	Runnable
	Running
	Waiting / Blocked
	Terminated
📌 Interview line:
“A thread goes through multiple states during execution.”
