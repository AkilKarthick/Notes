what is method hiding?

static method cannot be ovveridieen only hiding is possible
if both superclass and subclass have static method with the same signature- method hiding

means when a subclass defines a static method with the same name and signateur as a static method in its superclass
it looks like a method overriding! but sinec the method are static,, its actually hiding not overrding

2. if you add a null value to an empty set, what will be the size of the set?

  3. garbage collections?
4. cacn you override a static method in interface?
  no yuo cannot override 

  static method in interface belongs to the interface itself, not to the implenting class
  therefore, they vannot be inherited or overrident by implemnting class
  you can declare another static method with the same name in your class, but it will hide (not voerrid the one in the interface
