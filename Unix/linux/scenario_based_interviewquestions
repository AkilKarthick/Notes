1. find and kill the process that taking maximum memory?
   when you server is laging and you have to find the max occupied memory?


  ps aux  --sort=-&mem | head -n 5
then in order to kill the process
  sudo kill -9 processid
  
 1. ps aux = this list all the process with full details
             owner, processid, cpu and all those things
  
 2. --sort=-&mem = 
  sort the process by memory usage in descending order
  
 3.head -n 5 = this will show the top 5 memory consumers


2. we have some pipeline ran and some dployemen done & now something is broken
so we need to audit the recent changes that were done inside the specifi directory]
with respect to fils? 

find directorypath/ -type f -mmin -120

-type f = will limit the serach with in file only. ie search with respect
to files not folder!

this is helpful whiel debuggin!


3. suppose there is a frelaneer who need access to our server for one week
for a limited time only
so setup permission for user only for limited period ?

sudo useradd -e 2025-06-01 username1
sudo password user123

we can also do like user can change thier password one time

sudo change -d 0 username1

-e = expire on this mentioned date

4. to check which process is occupying which port or not?

lsof = means list the open files
