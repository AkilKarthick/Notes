i was working on linux based distribution
like rhel- redhaat enterpie linux to ubuntu (liux distrubiont)

why we migrated ?
  to reduce licensing cost & improbment environment flexiblity.
  rhel- is licenced enterprise OS, while ubunt is open src and widley used inn cloud env
  our application stack (java/springboot/mysql) is fully compatible with Ubuntu 
  so moving to ubnu helped reduce operation cost, simpllify pakage upgrades and 
  align with our Devops/cloud deployemnet stategy

also RHEL -require subscription licensing & Ubuntu is free and community supported
Ubuntu APT ecoysytem is faster and easier for package management
ubuntu is widely used in Docker & Kubernete environments

i'll be responsible 
  for installing required packages, 
  configuring java and tomcat, moving applicaiton
  config files,
  validationg service start/stop using ='systemctl'
  checking logs
  verifying access after deployment.

i was responsible for ensuring our java, springboot service ran smoothly after migration,
althoiugh we had a dedicated linux/ team maanging OS level changes.
worked closely with them to validate application dependencies,  configuration and service behaviour on 
the new environment
