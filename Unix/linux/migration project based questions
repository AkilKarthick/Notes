i was working on linux based distribution
like rhel- redhaat enterpie linux to ubuntu (liux distrubiont)

why we migrated ?
  to reduce licensing cost & improbment environment flexiblity.
  rhel- is licenced enterprise OS, while ubunt is open src and widley used inn cloud env
  our application stack (java/springboot/mysql) is fully compatible with Ubuntu 
  so moving to ubnu helped reduce operation cost, simpllify pakage upgrades and 
  align with our Devops/cloud deployemnet stategy

also RHEL -require subscription licensing & Ubuntu is free and community supported
Ubuntu APT ecoysytem is faster and easier for package management
ubuntu is widely used in Docker & Kubernete environments

i'll be responsible 
  for installing required packages, 
  configuring java and tomcat, moving applicaiton
  config files,
  validationg service start/stop using ='systemctl'
  checking logs
  verifying access after deployment.

i was responsible for ensuring our java, springboot service ran smoothly after migration,
althoiugh we had a dedicated linux/ team maanging OS level changes.
worked closely with them to validate application dependencies,  configuration and service behaviour on 
the new environment

I was part of the application team responsible for ensuring our Java + Spring Boot 
services ran smoothly after the migration. Although we had a dedicated Linux/Infrastructure
team managing OS-level changes, I worked closely with them to validate application 
dependencies, configurations, and service behavior on the new environment.


1. validated java version & ensured compatibility 
like updated JAVA-HOME environment variables
2.configured and verified our application server (apache)
a. like server starup and log path
3.moved application configuration files
a. .prop file for springboot
4. coordinated database connectivity: verified mysql connection string. ports, security configs
5. handled serice star.stop and validation
  used systemCTL statuc, systemctl restart 
6.log analysis for troubleshoortin
used grep, tail-f to review appp log and fix issues
7. performance & functional testing after migration
to ensure appliction behacviour and response time

so my role was primarly appplication level migation and validadtions
while linux team handled confgi/ infra setup os configruatoin etx

i had updated the config file, verifed serfver version, 
ensure correct connectivity with MySQL
validted serviec startup via SystemCtl 
checekd logs using grep and tail
perfomed smoke/regression testing to confirm the applicaiton was stable after migration
