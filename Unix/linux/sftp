we used SFTP for secure file transfer btwn servers
since both RHEL 7 UBUNTU were SSH enabled,
we used key-based authentication so that transfer happened without entering password manually


well be using sftp to securely transfer file btwn servers over ssh
it encrypst both 
data and credentials
so is is safer the FTP

we had to move applicaiton artifacts, condfig files, log files or DB dumps files from
RHEL SERVER  to UBUNTU SERVER securely, for that we used sftp SINCE BOTH SERVER supported SSH]

we'll be using SSH port 22
Reqired either: password authentication or SSH key based authentication

sftp user@hostname like sftp vn57mzw@ceru2016460
to upload file from current server to remote server
  put = command
to donwloda file
  get =command
to exit
  bye
