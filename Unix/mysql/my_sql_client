1.what is window function in mysql?

a powerfull tool, for performing calcuation across aset of  row 
, that some how related to cureent row without grouping the result (unlike GROUP BY)

function_name() OVER 
    ( [partion by colum_name] 
      [order by column_name]  )

1. ROW_MUMBER = assign a sequential number to rows in the result
        for eg
        select employee_id,department_id,salary
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(partion by department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_name
        FROM employees;
for eacch department employee are reanked by salary highest fiest and numbered 1,2,3..

2. RANK(): asigna  rank to each row with in a paritio, 
           but rows with equal valies received the same rank

select emp_id, depart_id
RANK() over(parition by deparment_id order by salary desc) as rank 
from employees;

simliar to row_number if two employee has same selary, they will share the same rank, and next rank will skip
  
3. DENSE_RANK() - but no gaps in rank number
    
4. SUM()
5. LAG()
6. LEAD()
