Experienced java interview questions!

1. which version of java you are using?
java8

2.how to create thread safe singleton class in java using double checked locking?

a.volatile keyword ensures visibility of changes to variable acrsss thread
            private static volatile Singelton instance;
to ensure multiple thread handles the instance varible correctly
when it is beig initialized to the singleton instance.

b.private construcot to prevent instantitation

c.double checking locking
  1.first if(instance == null) performed without locking
  2.check inside synchronized block ensures that only one thread
  initialize the instance variable.

eg:

public class Singelton {
   private static volatile Singelton instance;
    public Singleton(){
    }
    public static Singelton getInstance() {
        if(instance == null){
          //first check no locking
        synchronized(Singelton.class){
          if(instance == null){
              instance = new Singleton();
          }
        }
        }
      return instance;
    }
}

when the varilable is marked as volatile, cjhanges made to the variable by 
one thread are immiediatly visible to other threads
volatile also ensures that the varlues of the variable is always fetced
from the main memory and not from the thread local cahce

3.why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?

root cause is diamond problem
when a class inherit form two class it create diamond provlem
lead to ambiguity , it got confused which method to use

eg: class A{
  void display(){
  }
    class B extends A{
    void display(){
    }
    class C extends A{
    void display(){}  
    }
  //if java allowed multiple inheritnace
  class D extends B,C{
    // which display() method should D inhertis??

so we go for interface 
class D implements classB, classC //
  }
    }
}
