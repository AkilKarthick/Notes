1. WHAT IS SPRINGBOOT? YOUR UNDERSTANDING?

    a java based spring fm used for rapid appli development to build standalone
    microservice. it has extrea support of auto configuration and embedded app
    server like tomcat, jetty etc.

2.DIFFFERENCE BTWN SPRING AND SPRINGBOOT?
 Spring:
a. a wevpplication fm baed on java
b.provide tools and libraries to create customized web application
c.spring is more complex thatn springboot
d.takes an unopionated view
-------------------
springboot:
a.a module of spring
b.used to create a spring app project which can just run/eecute
c.is less comples that spring
d.takes an optinated view of a platofrm

3.FEATURE OF SPRINGBOOT?
  autoconfiguration
  springboot starter pom
  cli
  actuator
  Embeded Servers









--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.What is Spring Boot?
  Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework to create stand-alone 
  RESTful web applications with very minimal configuration and there is no need of external servers to run the application
  because it has embedded servers like Tomcat and Jetty etc.
  
  Spring Boot framework is independent.
  It creates executable spring applications that are production-grade.

2.features?

a.Auto-configuration – 
      Spring Boot automatically configures dependencies by using 
      @EnableAutoconfiguration annotation and reduces boilerplate code.

b.Spring Boot Starter POM – (project object model.xml)
      These Starter POMs are pre-configured dependencies for functions 
      like database, security, maven configuration etc.

c.Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) –
    This command line tool is generally for managing dependencies,
    creating projects and running the applications.

d.Actuator –
    Spring Boot Actuator provides health check,
    metrics and monitors the endpoints of the application.
    It also simplifies the troubleshooting management.

e.Embedded Servers – 
    Spring Boot contains embedded servers like Tomcat and Jetty 
    for quick application run. No need of external servers.

3.Advantages of using springboot?

Easy to use: The majority of the boilerplate code required to create a Spring application
    is reduced by Spring Boot.
Rapid Development: Spring Boot’s opinionated approach and auto-configuration enable developers 
    to quickly develop apps without the need for time-consuming setup, cutting down on development time.
Scalable: Spring Boot apps are intended to be scalable.
    This implies they may be simply scaled up or down to match your application’s needs.
Production-ready: Metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration 
    are just a few of the features that Spring Boot includes and are designed for use in production environments.

4. Define the Key Components of Spring Boot.
The key components of Spring Boot are listed below:

Spring Boot starters
Auto-configuration
Spring Boot Actuator
Spring Boot CLI
Embedded Servers

5. Why do we prefer Spring Boot over Spring?

Feature   --   Spring  --  Spring Boot
Ease of use --  More complex --  Easier
Production readiness -- Less production-ready -- More production-ready
Scalability --Less scalable --More scalable
