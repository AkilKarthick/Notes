java8-feature theory notes

what is java 8?
an advanced version of traditional java programming language and platform
launced on 2014, it is develper friedndly

1.what is lambda expression? 
  it is a type of function without a name called anonymous function
  thye can be only applied to single abstract method or functioninterface
  it is a functional programming, less boiler placte code
  before lambda sorting and similar operation in java often required implemetation of comparaotr interface 

syntax: (parameters) -> expression

Eg:
    @FunctionalInterface
    interface MathOperation{
      int operation(int a, int b);
    }
//without lambda exprression
    public class LambdaExample{
      public static void main(String[] args){
        MathOperation addition= new MathOperation(){
            @Override
            public int operation(int a, int b){
                return a + b;
            }
        };
          System.out.println("addition" + 
                        addition.operation(1,2));
      }
    }

//with lambda expression

 public class LambdaExample{
      public static void main(String[] args){
        MathOperation addition= (a,b) -> (a+b);
          System.out.println("addition" + 
                        addition.operation(1,2));
      }
    }
------------------------------------------------------
eg2:
public class LambdaExample{
    public static void main(String[] args){}{
          ArrayList<Integer> li = new ArrayList<>();
          li.add(1);
          li.add(2);
          li.add(3);
          //using lambda expression
          li.forEach((n)-> System.out::println(n));
    }
}
----------------------------------
what is the purpose of Stream API?
to process collections of data in a functional & declarative way
a pipeline of operations is introduced through which one can fileter,map,sort
and reduce data without changing the orginal collection.

what is default method?
we can add new functionalites/method to interface without breaking existing
implmentation.

what is optinal class represent?
to avoid NUllpointer exception 

what is functinal interface?
lambda expression are used to define functiona interface. it is an interface with
single abstract method. eg Runnable interface is FI with sinle method run().

importance of stream api

how does new date and tima api work

role of nashorn in java8

method reference in java8

use of ForEach in java8

difference between Map & FlatMap?

how is parallel stream different from stream?
