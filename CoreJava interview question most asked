what is java main() method?
when we execute our java pgm the jvm will looks for main method to begin 
and only one main metho
public static void main(String[] args)

a. String[] args
   a parameter passes command line argument into java applcation
extracting values from the command line in string format ie
 String[] args = {"1","2"}; these stored in args[0], args[1]
later be stored in args array

b. static keyword? in main method?

to make it as globally access across the class

static variable - a public access eg publlic summing pool
static method - are like shared serverice eg secuity gurad 
               any body can access

what is abstract class in java?

abstract class shape {
  public abstrat void draw();
  public void erase   // a concrete method ie non abstract method
   System.out.println("a"); 
  }
}
if a subc/ child clas inhert  the shape class
class circle extends Shape{
// the abstract method must be defined here 
   @Override
   public void draw(){
       System.out.println(drawing a cirvle);
   }
}
what is an interface?

here every method is by default abstract
interface are used to solve the problem of multipl inhertance in java
multipel inheritacn is not possible in java so interface takes place

what is package in java?

buit in package - predefined classes and interccae like java.util etc 
user defined package - to keet our poject structured & manageble
             to  organized the code 

what is the used of this keyword in java?

to refer the curretn instance
also used to call another constructro within the same class



 1.why pointer is not used in java
 
 we know jvm is responsbile for memory allocation in java, to stop direct access to memory in java pointer is discourged
 and they are unsafe
 
 2.what is jit compiler?

---------concluseion------------
so jdk is for developer to create java applications
jre is for used to run java application
------------
 from --scr code to (jdk for conversion) --byte code
 from --byte code to (jvm for conversion (insidee jvm we have[jit compiler and interpreter])) --machine code

jdk--java development kit that provide all the tools required to
 develop,complile and run the java app
 jdk we have
 compiler - 
 debugger
 jre - bunch of libraries

jvm- java virtual machine
 key component - memory management = allo/deallo memory for the applcation
 -garbage collection = automatically  cleans up unused memory
 -security = 


what are access modifier?

public if a class, method or variable is public is can be access anywhere
private - elements is accessible within the class 
protected- accessible within same package and by sub class
         use this when you want to give access to the sub class, even they are ins
differnet package
default - when nothing is specifed java applies default
      no modifier when you want to limit access to class within the same package
but keep members hidden from classes in other package


 
 3.what is marker interface?
 
 an interface which has no data member and member fucntions 
simply an empty interface eg serializable , cloneable etc
then why dont we have it, means it tells the compiler that someting to do with it
particular thing to do to for jdk and compiler

 hint ctrl shift t
 public interfcae Cloneable{
 }

4. can we override private or static method in java??

we cannot overrid privat method- we can only create another private methid
with same name in the child class

for static method if you override then it will hide the supercalss method
known as method hidding...

5. Does finally alwas execute in java?

not in the following case
1. "System.exit()" function  when we cally it explicitally
2. system crash

6. what method does object class have?

clone()
equals()
finalize()
hashcode() return hascode value for the oject
getClass()

7.what is singleton class in java? how can we make a class singleton??
 only one instance is created at any givenn time in one JVM


public class Animal{
private static Animal single_instance = null;

private Animal(){
}

public static Animal getIntance(){
 if(single_instance ==null)
   single_instance = new Animal();
}
 return single_insatnce;
}

1st make sure make your constructo as private to make sure nobody can create any
then to create one oject, we have to crearte one

2nd,  public static Animal single_instance= null;

3rd we have to create a static block for the same which will return the same class oject

-----

is java is pass by value or pass by reference??

pass by value-- sending memory address of the value
pass by reference-- reather than passing real memory address, 
                     it send the copy in another mem location
