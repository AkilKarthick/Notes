@Transactionl

Starts a transaction
Commits on success
Rolls back on RuntimeException

@Transactional ensures rollback if any runtime exception occur
by default roll back happed for unchecked exception!!

does it roll back for checekd exception ❓
 ❌ No (by default)
we need to give like this  
✅ To rollback for checked exceptions:
@Transactional(rollbackFor = Exceptoin.class)


  @Autowired
  private UserRepository userRepository;

  @Transactional
  public void registerUser(User user) {
    // If any exception occurs here, transaction will rollback automatically
    userRepository.save(user);

a transaction is a single unit of work that must either 
Complete fully ✅
Or rollback completely ❌

a transaction ensure data consistency by treating multiple DB operations as a single unit of work!
