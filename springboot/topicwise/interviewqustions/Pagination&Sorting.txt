PAGINATION & SORTING
--------------------
suppose we have a dashboard of million of records if you load the page then everything lags right, bcz you are trying to fetch all the records at once And that's not scalable

----------
Pagination: 
----------
it's the technique of breaking large data sets into smaller, manageable chunks or pages
instead of sending 10,000 rows you sending 20 at a time


springboot already has a inbuilt interface called Pageable interface

Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNo, pageSize);

then use this in your JPA query

public List<Employee> getAllEmp(Pageable pageable){

	return employeeRepository.findAll(pageable);
}

-------
Sorting
-------
want to sort the data ?
just use spring sort class

Sort sort = Sort.by("name").ascending();

now add this sort object into pageable 

Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNo, pageSize.sort);
