PAGINATION & SORTING
--------------------
suppose we have a dashboard of million of records if you load the page then everything lags right, bcz you are trying to fetch all the records at once And that's not scalable

findAll() //loads everyting
load huge data into memory, it slow response & high DB load

with Pagination: fetch limited records, faster API and scalbe

----------
Pagination: 
----------

Pagination improves performance by fetching only required records instead of loading the entire dataset

it's the technique of breaking large data sets into smaller, manageable chunks or pages
instead of sending 10,000 rows you sending 20 at a time
🔹 Pageable

Defines:
Page number
Page size
Sorting

🔹 Page

Contains:
Data
Total pages
Total elements
springboot already has a inbuilt interface called 🔹Pageable interface

	🔹Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNo, pageSize);

then use this in your JPA query

	public List<Employee> getAllEmp(Pageable pageable){
		return employeeRepository.findAll(pageable);
	}

🎤 Interview explanation:
We use Pageable to control page size and avoid loading large datasets.

-------
Sorting
-------
want to sort the data ?
just use spring sort class

Sort sort = Sort.by("name").ascending();

now add this sort object into pageable 

🔹Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNo, pageSize, Sort.by("name").ascending());

multiple fields

Sort sort = Sort.by("name").ascending()
                .and(Sort.by("createdAt").descending());

“Pagination works seamlessly with custom JPQL queries



Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNo, pageSize.sort);

REAL PROJECT PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (RESUME LINK 🔥)
❓ How did you improve performance by 25%?

“By optimizing queries, adding indexes, and using pagination to reduce large data fetches.”
This directly matches your resume

Where is pagination applied?
	Controller / Service layer
