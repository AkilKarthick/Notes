How Java Converts Map<String, Object> to JSON

Spring Boot has Jackson processor on the classpath by default,
 it automatically handles:

a.Serialization of Java objects to JSON

b.Deserialization of JSON to Java objects (like with @RequestBody)




Spring Boot uses Jackson, a powerful JSON processor, to automatically convert Java objects (like your Map) into JSON when returning a response from a controller.

Spring uses Jackson to serialize the map.
