global exception handler

It’s a specialized component in Spring that allows you to handle exceptions

When you annotate a class with @ControllerAdvice, Spring treats it as a global interceptor for controller methods.

Any controller that throws a ResourceNotFoundException will be intercepted by this method.

You don’t need to duplicate exception-handling logic in every controller.
The response is automatically serialized to JSON (thanks to Jackson), and returned to the client—like Postman.

--------------------------------------------
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<Map<String, Object>> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        // Build response body
    }
}
