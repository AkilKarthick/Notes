how to enable logging in springboot application:

springboot comes with inbuilt logging support "SLF4J API"  and logback

step1: "spring-boot-starter-web" this dependencies include logging by default so no extra is 	needed

step2: on application.properties file

logging.level.root=INFO
logging.level.com.example.demo=DEBUG

sets the global log level to INFO and the package com.example.demo to DEBUG to provide more detailed logs during development

Create logger variable like

@RestController
public class HelloController {

//creatin variable
private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(classname.class)

 @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {

        logger.debug("Debug level log");
        logger.info("Info level log");
        logger.warn("Warn level log");
        logger.error("Error level log");

        return "Hello Logging";
    }
