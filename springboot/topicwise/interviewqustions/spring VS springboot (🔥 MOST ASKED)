springboot vs spring
--------------------

1.it is a java framework,that simplifies building production ready applications


🔹🔹on spring ( here is a heavy xml confgiruations) & manual dependency setup
2.AutoConfigurations: springboot
	provides auto-configurations to setup componenets automatically based upon dependeicies
springboot automatically confiure beans based on :
	classpath dependencies
	application.properties
	Annotations
for EG: if spring-boot-starter-data-jpa is present
then: Datasoure, entity manager, transaction manager are auto configured!!

🎤 Interview line
“Auto-configuration reduces boilerplate by configuring beans automatically based on dependencies.”

3.Embedded Server(Tomcat)
	applicaions are standalone with embedded server like tomact 
	no external server configurations setup is needed

4.Minimal Configurations | 5.Starter dependencies
	springboot support microserice architecture and is highly customzable
	comes with producion ready feature like healthhekcsmetricies and monitorings
	eliminate boiler plate code and xml configuration , letting devepers focus on business logics

5.optionated - means has some default like embedded tomcat default web container
6.Customizable - though it has some default , but easily customizable at any time during your 
		development time. if your prefer jetty you can change that, on pom file

”

🏗️ Project usage
“We used Spring Boot to quickly develop 
and deploy REST-based microservices without manual configuration.”

3️⃣ IOC & Dependency Injection (CORE CONCEPT)

IOC- inversion of controll
spring controls: object creations, dependeny manangement, life cycle
not by us(developer)

component scanning:
springbot scan , main class package and all sub packages
so scan automatically based on package structure.



Springboot 2 features

require java 8, support java 9 as well
spring boot require spring 5 as a baseline
jetty is 9.4 ad tomcat is 8.5


lates version of sprinboot is 3.5.6

------------------

implement service layer with spring core
repository layer with spring data jpa
web layer with spring mvc
log the error message using logback
perform unit testing with junit and Mockito
load environment specific configuration using profiles
secure application using spring security
build rest web servce and consume it
monitor the health of applicaitn using Acturaotors


❓ “How does Spring Boot know what to configure automatically?”

springboot autoconfiguration works using @EnableAutoConfigurations
it scans the classpath and applies conditional configuration bsed on availble dependencies
